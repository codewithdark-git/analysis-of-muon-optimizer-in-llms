\begin{abstract}
This study evaluates the Muon optimizer, a novel momentum-based optimizer with Newton-Schulz orthogonalization, in a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) transformer-based Large Language Model (LLM). Through four experiments, we investigate: (1) Muon versus AdamW, (2) ablation of Muon’s momentum and Newton-Schulz components, (3) hyperparameter sensitivity, and (4) performance across activation functions (SiLU, GELU, ReLU, Tanh) and attention mechanisms (Multi-Head Self-Attention, MHSA; Multi-Head Latent Attention, MHLA). Using a 500,000-token subset of the SmolLM corpus, we find that Muon with MHSA-ReLU achieves superior performance (validation loss: 4.6883, perplexity: 108.67), while MHLA’s linear complexity (\(O(nk)\)) promises scalability for long-term training and extended sequences. These findings, contributed to an open-source project, highlight Muon’s stability in sparse MoE architectures and MHLA’s potential for efficient long-context processing. Ongoing research includes extended training runs, latent count ablations, and theoretical convergence analyses to further validate these results.

\section{Introduction}
Training Large Language Models (LLMs) at scale demands optimizers and architectures that balance computational efficiency, memory usage, and gradient stability. The AdamW optimizer \cite{loshchilov2017decoupled, kingma2014adam} is widely used but faces challenges in memory scaling and stability for sparse architectures like Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). The Muon optimizer, leveraging Newton-Schulz orthogonalization for momentum-based updates, reduces optimizer state memory by up to 50\% and enhances stability in high-dimensional settings \cite{bernstein2020metricizing, liu2025muon, jordan2024muon}. Similarly, Multi-Head Latent Attention (MHLA) offers linear complexity (\(O(nk)\)) compared to Multi-Head Self-Attention’s (MHSA) quadratic scaling (\(O(n^2d)\)), enabling efficient processing of long sequences \cite{jaegle2021perceiver, li2025transmla}.

This paper investigates the Muon optimizer in an MoE transformer LLM, focusing on its synergy with MHSA, MHLA, and various activation functions (SiLU, GELU, ReLU, Tanh). We address four research questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item How does a hybrid Muon optimizer compare to AdamW in performance and computational cost?
    \item What are the contributions of Muon’s momentum and Newton-Schulz orthogonalization components?
    \item How sensitive is Muon to its key hyperparameters?
    \item How do activation functions and attention mechanisms impact Muon’s performance and scalability?
\end{itemize}
These experiments, conducted on a 500,000-token dataset, contribute to an open-source project aimed at scalable LLM training \cite{rosic2025muonrepo}. Our findings highlight Muon’s immediate performance benefits and MHLA’s potential for long-term efficiency, with implications for trillion-parameter models like Kimi K2 \cite{moonshot2025kimi}.

\section{Background}
\subsection{Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Models}
MoE models employ a router network to direct input tokens to a subset of expert networks, enabling high capacity with reduced computational cost via sparse activation \cite{shazeer2017outrageously}. This sparsity synergizes with Muon’s orthogonal updates, which stabilize training in high-dimensional layers \cite{liu2025muon}.

\subsection{The Muon Optimizer}
The Muon optimizer (MomentUm Orthogonalized by Newton-Schulz) processes parameter matrices with the update rule:
\[
\mathbf{g}' = \mathcal{NS}(\mathbf{g} \odot \mathbf{m}), \quad \theta \leftarrow \theta - \eta \cdot \sqrt{\max(1, \frac{d_{\text{out}}}{d_{\text{in}}}})} \cdot \mathbf{g}'
\]
where \(\mathcal{NS}(\cdot)\) is a 5-step Newton-Schulz iteration for matrix polar decomposition, \(\mathbf{g}\) is the gradient, \(\mathbf{m}\) is the momentum buffer, and \(\eta\) is the learning rate \cite{schulz1933iteratives, jordan2024muon}. A hybrid approach applies Muon to 2D weight matrices (e.g., attention, feed-forward) and AdamW to embeddings and normalization layers, balancing efficiency and stability.

\subsection{Attention Mechanisms}
MHSA computes token-to-token attention with complexity \(O(n^2d)\), where \(n\) is the sequence length and \(d\) is the model dimension \cite{vaswani2017attention}. MHLA, inspired by Perceiver IO, uses a two-stage cross-attention process:
\[
\text{Stage 1: } \text{Latents} \leftarrow \text{CrossAttention}(\text{Latents}, \text{Input}, \text{Input})
\]
\[
\text{Stage 2: } \text{Output} \leftarrow \text{CrossAttention}(\text{Input}, \text{Latents}, \text{Latents})
\]
This reduces complexity to \(O(nkd)\), where \(k \ll n\) is the number of latent tokens (e.g., 64), saving 75-97\% memory for sequences beyond 512 tokens \cite{jaegle2021perceiver, li2025transmla, deepseek2025v2}.

\section{Experimental Setup}
All experiments used a consistent MoE transformer architecture and dataset to ensure comparability:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Model Architecture}: 6-layer MoE Transformer with model dimension 384, 8 attention heads, feed-forward dimension 1536, 8 experts, top-2 routing, and 64 latent tokens for MHLA.
    \item \textbf{Dataset}: 500,000-token subset of the SmolLM corpus (cosmopedia-v2) \cite{huggingface2024smollm}.
    \item \textbf{Training Parameters}: Experiments 1–3 used 1000 steps, batch size 24, and 4 gradient accumulation steps. Experiment 4 used 500 steps and batch size 16 due to the combinatorial testing of 8 configurations (4 activations × 2 attention types). Muon learning rate was set to 0.01, with seeds fixed at 42.
    \item \textbf{Hardware}: NVIDIA RTX 4090 or Google Colab T4 GPU (15.8 GB memory).
\end{itemize}
The experiments were designed to answer the research questions by evaluating Muon’s performance, component contributions, hyperparameter sensitivity, and interactions with activation functions and attention mechanisms.

\section{Results and Analysis}
\subsection{Experiment 1: Baseline Comparison (Muon vs. AdamW)}
This experiment compared a hybrid Muon optimizer (Muon for 2D layers, AdamW for embeddings/norms) against a pure AdamW optimizer.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Baseline Comparison: Muon vs. AdamW Performance}
\label{tab:exp1}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lccc@{}}
\toprule
Metric & Muon & AdamW & Difference (\%) \\ \midrule
Validation Loss & \textbf{0.0476} & 0.0547 & -13.2 \\
Validation Accuracy & \textbf{0.9907} & 0.9881 & +0.26 \\
Validation Perplexity & \textbf{1.05} & 1.06 & -0.94 \\
Training Time (min) & 13.3 & \textbf{11.8} & +12.7 \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Table \ref{tab:exp1} shows that Muon outperforms AdamW by 13.2\% in validation loss, 0.26\% in accuracy, and 0.94\% in perplexity. The 12.7\% increase in training time is due to the computational overhead of Newton-Schulz iterations, but Muon’s stability in sparse MoE layers justifies this cost \cite{liu2025muon}. This aligns with Muon’s adoption in production models like Kimi K2, which achieved stable training at trillion-parameter scale \cite{moonshot2025kimi}.

\subsection{Experiment 2: Ablation Study}
This experiment evaluated the contributions of Muon’s momentum and Newton-Schulz (NS) orthogonalization components.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Ablation Study: Muon Component Contributions}
\label{tab:exp2}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lcccc@{}}
\toprule
Variant & Val Loss & Val Acc & Val PPL & Time (min) \\ \midrule
Full Muon (Momentum + NS) & \textbf{2.5347} & \textbf{0.4948} & \textbf{12.61} & 2.7 \\
Momentum Only (No NS) & 5.4336 & 0.1385 & 228.98 & \textbf{2.4} \\
NS Only (No Momentum) & 3.8273 & 0.2926 & 45.94 & 2.7 \\
Basic SGD-like (No Both) & 5.2608 & 0.1628 & 192.63 & \textbf{2.4} \\ \bottomrule
\multicolumn{5}{l}{\small Loss increase vs. Full Muon: Momentum Only (+114.4\%), NS Only (+51.0\%).}
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Table \ref{tab:exp2} demonstrates strong synergy between momentum and NS, with Full Muon reducing loss by 114.4\% compared to momentum-only and 51.0\% compared to NS-only. Momentum is the dominant contributor, as its removal causes a larger performance drop, consistent with Muon’s design for sparse architectures where momentum stabilizes expert routing \cite{shazeer2017outrageously, liu2025muon].

\subsection{Experiment 3: Hyperparameter Sensitivity}
This experiment assessed Muon’s sensitivity to learning rate, momentum, and the number of Newton-Schulz steps.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Hyperparameter Sensitivity: Optimal Values}
\label{tab:exp3}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lc@{}}
\toprule
Hyperparameter & Optimal Value (Val Loss) \\ \midrule
Learning Rate & 0.05 (0.3277) \\
Momentum & 0.95 (2.5296) \\
Newton-Schulz Steps & 7 (2.4955) \\ \bottomrule
\multicolumn{2}{l}{\small Sensitivity: Learning Rate (18.6x loss improvement), Momentum (moderate), NS Steps (weak).}
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Table \ref{tab:exp3} indicates high sensitivity to the learning rate, with a 18.6x loss improvement at 0.05 compared to the worst-tested value. Momentum (optimal at 0.95) shows moderate sensitivity, while NS steps (optimal at 7) exhibit weak sensitivity, with diminishing returns beyond 5 steps. These findings suggest that learning rate tuning is critical for Muon’s performance in MoE settings.

\subsection{Experiment 4: Activation Functions and Attention Mechanisms}
This experiment evaluated Muon across MHSA and MHLA with four activation functions (SiLU, GELU, ReLU, Tanh) over 500 steps, using a batch size of 16 to accommodate the 8 configurations.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Activation and Attention Performance with Muon}
\label{tab:exp4}
\begin{tabular}{@{}llcccc@{}}
\toprule
Attention & Activation & Val Loss & Val Acc & Val PPL & Time (min) \\ \midrule
MHSA & ReLU & \textbf{4.6883} & \textbf{0.2560} & \textbf{108.67} & 3.5 \\
MHSA & GELU & 4.6929 & 0.2549 & 109.17 & 3.5 \\
MHSA & SiLU & 4.7206 & 0.2533 & 112.24 & 3.6 \\
MHSA & Tanh & 4.8262 & 0.2463 & 124.74 & 3.5 \\
MHLA & ReLU & 4.7078 & 0.2459 & 110.80 & 3.5 \\
MHLA & GELU & 4.7267 & 0.2440 & 112.92 & 3.5 \\
MHLA & SiLU & 4.7581 & 0.2423 & 116.52 & 3.5 \\
MHLA & Tanh & 4.85* & 0.24* & 130* & 3.5 \\ \bottomrule
\multicolumn{6}{l}{\small *Estimated based on training loss (5.2872) trends, as final evaluation was incomplete.}
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Table \ref{tab:exp4} identifies MHSA-ReLU as the optimal configuration, achieving a validation loss of 4.6883 and perplexity of 108.67. ReLU’s sparsity synergizes with Muon’s orthogonal updates and MoE’s top-2 routing, stabilizing training and enhancing expert specialization \cite{shazeer2017outrageously, liu2025muon]. MHLA configurations show a 0.4–2\% higher loss, attributed to the initial learning phase of latent tokens, but their training times are comparable (3.5–3.6 minutes), suggesting efficiency for longer runs. The incomplete MHLA-Tanh evaluation was estimated based on its training loss (5.2872), which trends higher than MHSA-Tanh (5.5810), indicating consistent underperformance of Tanh due to gradient saturation \cite{li2025transmla}.

\subsection{MHLA Scalability Analysis}
MHLA’s theoretical advantages over MHSA make it a promising candidate for extended training and long-sequence tasks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Latent Maturation}: Latent tokens learn global context over time, projecting a 5–10\% lower loss after 800 steps compared to MHSA \cite{li2025transmla}. This is because latents act as learned summaries, refining cross-attention patterns over iterations.
    \item \textbf{Computational Efficiency}: MHLA’s complexity scales as \(O(nkd)\), compared to MHSA’s \(O(n^2d)\). For a sequence length of 512 tokens, MHLA achieves a 4x FLOPS reduction (25.2M vs. 100.7M); at 2048 tokens, this becomes 16x (100.7M vs. 1.61B) \cite{jaegle2021perceiver}.
    \item \textbf{Memory Savings}: MHLA reduces memory usage by 75–97\% for sequences beyond 512 tokens (e.g., 0.25 MB vs. 1.0 MB at 512 tokens, 2.0 MB vs. 67.1 MB at 4096 tokens), enabling larger batch sizes and stable gradients \cite{deepseek2025v2}.
\end{itemize}
While MHSA outperforms MHLA by 0.7\% in short-term validation loss (Table \ref{tab:exp4}), MHLA’s linear scaling suggests a performance crossover in extended training (800+ steps) or with longer sequences (>1024 tokens). This aligns with findings in TransMLA, where MHLA conversion yields 1–2\% perplexity gains in post-training \cite{li2025transmla}, and DeepSeek-V2, which achieves 93.3\% memory reduction via similar techniques \cite{deepseek2025v2}.

\section{Summary of Results and Future Work}
\subsection{Summary of Current Results}
The experiments provide a comprehensive evaluation of the Muon optimizer in an MoE transformer LLM:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Baseline Comparison}: Muon outperforms AdamW by 13.2\% in validation loss, 0.26\% in accuracy, and 0.94\% in perplexity, with a 12.7\% training time overhead due to Newton-Schulz iterations.
    \item \textbf{Ablation Study}: Momentum and Newton-Schulz orthogonalization are synergistic, with momentum driving a 114.4\% larger loss reduction than NS alone, critical for sparse MoE stability.
    \item \textbf{Hyperparameter Sensitivity}: Muon is highly sensitive to learning rate (18.6x loss improvement at 0.05), moderately sensitive to momentum (0.95 optimal), and weakly sensitive to NS steps (7 optimal).
    \item \textbf{Activation and Attention Mechanisms}: MHSA-ReLU achieves the best performance (loss: 4.6883, perplexity: 108.67), leveraging ReLU’s sparsity with Muon’s stable updates. MHLA configurations show slightly higher losses (0.4–2\%) but promise scalability due to linear complexity and 75–97\% memory savings for long sequences.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Future Work}
This research is ongoing, with planned experiments to further validate and extend these findings:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Conduct 2000-step training runs to confirm MHLA’s projected performance crossover at 800+ steps, as suggested by latent maturation trends \cite{li2025transmla}.
    \item Perform ablations on MHLA latent counts (32, 64, 128) and sequence lengths (1024, 2048, 4096) to optimize efficiency and performance.
    \item Derive theoretical convergence bounds for Muon-MHLA using Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis to quantify stability and generalization \cite{jacot2018ntk}.
    \item Test on multimodal datasets like LAION-5B to assess Muon and MHLA’s generality across data types \cite{schuhmann2022laion}.
    \item Profile Newton-Schulz computational overhead to identify optimization bottlenecks, potentially integrating with Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) frameworks \cite{rosic2025muonrepo}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
The Muon optimizer demonstrates significant potential for efficient and stable training of MoE transformer LLMs, particularly when paired with MHSA-ReLU, which achieves the lowest validation loss (4.6883) and perplexity (108.67) in short-term training. MHLA, while slightly less performant in 500 steps, offers linear complexity and substantial memory savings, positioning it as a scalable solution for long-term training and extended sequences. These findings, contributed to an open-source project \cite{rosic2025muonrepo}, provide actionable insights for optimizing trillion-parameter models like Kimi K2 \cite{moonshot2025kimi}. Future work will focus on validating MHLA’s long-term advantages and developing theoretical foundations to enhance Muon’s adoption in large-scale LLM training.
